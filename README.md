## Features

- Fonts, colors etc. can be configured from `.Xresource` file. No need to `restart or recompile st`.
- Texts don't cut while resizing terminal.
- Support transparency while keeping text opaque. This is controlled by `alpha` variable in `config.def.h` or `.Xresources`.
- Support font ligatures.
- Select `url` from terminal window. Put `st-urlhandler` in your path variable. Use <kbd>alt+u</kbd> to open url and use <kbd>alt+y</kbd> to copy url.
- Dynamic-color cursor support make terminal appealing and easy to follow cursor.
- Support blinking cursor. Blink-rate is managed by `blinktimeout` variable in `config.def.h` or `.Xresource`.
- St opacity can be changed without `restarting` or `recompiling`.
- Support for spare font besides default. If some glyph is not present in default then this `spare` font will be used.

## Requirements

the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as root):

```
sudo make clean install
```
